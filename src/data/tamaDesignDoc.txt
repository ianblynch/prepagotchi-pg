Then I will make editor for radiation


I do all to put into phone gap
Make white frame
Title screen
X Set border, padding dynamically
PowerStartAndStop: check flex (might be fine)
Shoot: check flex (might be fine)
Start Kickstarter
Make background images into html elements so we can animate them
X button labels
Add yellow background to top and bottom?
XCleanup CWB
X disable button clicks when transitioning from TamaNexus to gameCard

X Fix classic wheelchair ball not going 100% height
X Fix screen not resizing when aspect ratio is very narrow
X consolidate and check event listeners to one call per event (onResize(), onClick())
X add this.setImageRendering() to each card's onResize()

make the sprites cuter/heads bigger

Edits for each card:
X ScoreTransCard: fix flex
X Lead: fix flex to space evenly

X Socialize: fix flex
X Lift: fix flex

X Dribbling: set new ball x, y on resize
X Eat: set new meat x, y on resize

X Stats: broken fix flex

X Socialize: fix image resize weird on resize
X Lift: fix image resize weird on resize

X Dribbling, Eat: make img scale according to size of screen





XMake the outer frame area fixed just like the middle flex area => can set it in the same setInnerWidth() in TamaHome
XLight gray beyond or just fill it up with a subdued prepagotchi background

XTest and refine ux
XNormalize SocializeCard to match edits to LiftsCard
XContinue replacing static text with MushyText components
XMake frame and background

X To start current game screen should be load screen, during this 
it loads the local storage and sets the current screen

X Icon zoom-in transition when select game
X Screen resizes to consistently fit in different viewports
X Egg hatches at beginning (enter name)
X Idle animations on main screen
X Fix egg hatch so the right egg is shown on initial load
X Logic for 7 health meters (and when dies)
X Add transitionFromGame() as end of all games like DribbleCard
Title screen
X Grave screen when dies
X Figure out how to trigger - set timeout

1. Compose TheClassicWheelchairBall tidbits as progression rewards
2. set criteria and watchers for classic wheelchair ball
3. Add more idle animations
4. Normalize LiftCard to match edits to SocializeCard
5. Make heads bigger

Wish:
Fix sizing now that idle-screen is fixed statically:
    Works on all games except socialize and lift... possible solutions is to resize with JS or to just fix the game to stay in portrait mode.






Egg hatches 
If xyz then he dies (grave and RIP)
Transition to game is close up of card in the middle
The Classic Wheelchair Ball.txt is given piece by piece as a reward for keeping him alive.

Games to add:
Eat (remix of dribble game)
Stretch (remix of hifive game)
Shoot (bar fills then release)
