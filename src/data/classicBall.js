    `The Classic Wheelchair Ball`,
    `Once upon a time there lived a wheelchair that had a basketball. There was also a person who loved spaghetti. The person dreamed about wheelchairs that could think of going to new places and teleport up stairs!`,
    `This person also truly loved dancing while dribbling basketballs on top of a hotel that had too many rooms. One day, this person thought of hosting a tournament within the town at the hotel. They would compete with other people, employees, penguins, and sentient wheelchairs.`,
    `In order to organize the tournament this person had to make the penguins do tricks for money. The penguins had a labor dispute, but did not accept, so they started a revolution. Their first ally was the sentient wheelchairs. This coalition was called The Distribution of Mars. Their first plan was to steal all wheelchairs and basketballs that couldn't think.`,
    `Their hope was that if they stole the leaders of the wheelchairs they could transform her directives into big cheeseburgers because they wanted to feed the factory aliens who manufactured basketballs that were smarter than the wheelchairs so they could rule the world.`,
    `One night after the sun went down the penguins started to get restless so they began creeping, and crawling, and scooting, and walking towards the hotel.  This jogged their memory of the Distribution, of which they were esteemed members of.`,
    `The tourament, they recalled, allowed them to stall and distract the players and employees so that they could kidnap some ABs.  Ronald McDonald fell into a hole that led to his death. In the hole there was a sentient wheelchair who started slurping up the remains of the dead clown.`,
    `This greatly pleased the overlord penguins that Ronald McDonald wanted to make mercenaries for the Revolution.  The Penguin Emperor was so sad he cried himself to the store because he had to console himself with encouragement and also grab a frozen pizza.`,
    `Meanwhile, the facory aliens and the perpetrators within the hotel staff locked the manager with the wheelchairs that tried to attack him as they were sleeping.  Luckily, the penguins and wheelchairs did not care as they had already tasted the manager's food so they decided once they put it in their mouth they did not like it.`,
    `The person, who had an acorn hat and stylish coat, was planning the tournament which prohibited the game to go on that afternoon.  The Revolution was coming and everyone could feel it shaking the Earth: the game was finally here.`,
    `Two sides, the Distribution of Mars with the Martians versus the person, hotel staff, and the employees.  Some people assumed it was a basketball game but in truth that was not the choice or reasoning the Martians founded the Distribution upon.`,
    `The mortals needed to die because they were smarter than the aliens.  Once again, the tournament was postponed and the person was extremely sad.  Where is the manager during this!?`,
